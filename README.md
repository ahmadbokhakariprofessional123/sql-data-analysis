# SQL Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates practical **SQL skills for data analysis**, focusing on extracting insights from structured data using real-world style business questions.

The goal of this project is to show how SQL can be used to:
- Explore datasets
- Answer analytical questions
- Perform aggregations and filtering
- Support data-driven decision making

This project is designed to reflect the kind of SQL tasks commonly required in **Junior Data Analyst** and **Junior ML Engineer** roles.

## 🗂️ Dataset Description
The dataset represents a relational database with multiple tables (e.g. customers, transactions, products, or similar entities).

It is used to simulate realistic analytics scenarios such as:
- Understanding customer behavior
- Analyzing performance metrics
- Identifying trends and patterns in the data

*(Exact schema and tables are explored directly in the notebook.)*

---

## 🔍 Key Questions Answered
Some of the analytical questions explored in this project include:
- What are the key trends in the data?
- Which categories / entities contribute the most to overall performance?
- How does performance vary across different groups or time periods?
- What insights can be derived to support business decisions?

## 🛠️ SQL Skills Demonstrated
This project showcases hands-on experience with:

- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`
- Aggregations (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`)
- `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`
- Joins between multiple tables
- Subqueries and logical filtering
- Writing clean, readable, and well-structured SQL queries

---

## 📊 Analysis Approach
1. **Data Exploration** – understanding table structures and relationships  
2. **Query Design** – writing efficient SQL queries to answer specific questions  
3. **Aggregation & Filtering** – summarizing data to extract meaningful insights  
4. **Interpretation** – translating query results into clear analytical conclusions  

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- SQL is a powerful tool for extracting insights from structured data
- Well-written queries can directly answer real business questions
- Clear logic and readability are as important as correctness in SQL analysis

This project reflects my ability to work with databases in a practical analytics setting.
